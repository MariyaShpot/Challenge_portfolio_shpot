# **Task 1: Software Configuration**

### Subtask 1: Why did I choose to participate in the _**Dare IT Challenge**_?

Hello! My name is _**Mariya-Roksolyana**_ and I love manual testing!ðŸ˜ƒ 
You might wonder why did I choose to participate in the _Automated_ Testing challenge then?
Well...because I also like to challenge myselfðŸ˜… As simple as that! 
My _goal_ for this challenge is to learn as much as possible from knowledgeable experts 
and to get a grasp on what it takes to automate testsðŸ’ª 
Not only will it help me expand my professional skills, but also give me a chance to apply 
for some better-paying jobs in the future (at least I hope so!)ðŸ˜Š

Anyway, I am looking forward to what this experience has in store for me and I wish good luck 
to all my fellow participants!ðŸ˜‰
